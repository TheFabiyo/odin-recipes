     </p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 cups of Water</li>
        <li>1 pound of your Choice of Meat</li>
        <li>about 3 cups of top shoot from stinging nettle, may be supplemented with other herbs</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the meat in cold water and boil for about an hour. Nettles and herbs are washed and hacked and added to the soup. Slice the meat into small pieces when it is tender and put them back into the soup. Add salt.</li>
        <li>The soup will taste best if the nettle is supplemented with other herbs, for example young dandelion leaves, bishop's weed, broadleaf plantain, wild gooseberry, wild onion, garlic mustard, thyme, wild marjoram, dille, garden angelica or cumin. You are obviously not supposed to use all of these herbs in the same soup, and remember that the spice herbs should be used in small quantities.</li>
        <li>If you desire a more filling soup you may add whetted wheat kernels, course flour or pea flour. If you have made cheese a bit of whey can be added to the soup, providing a somewhat sourish taste.</li>
    </ol>
